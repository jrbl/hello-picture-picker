= Introduction =
PicturePicker picks pictures from the web at random, in response to nearly 
meaningless textual inputs (ie, tweets).  It pairs them, and shows them.

Not much to it.

= Requirements = 
* flask         http://flask.pocoo.org
* simplejson    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
* lxml.html     http://lxml.de

This version of PicturePicker is a crude prototype written in python, and self-
hosting via the http micro server available via the Flask framework.  It relies 
on several other features of Flask, too.

Parsing of web services results is via simplejson, so you'll need that too.

Parsing of resulting web content is via lxml.html, which is teh awesome.  

These may imply their own dependencies.  While you should never use this code 
in production, if you *were* going to do that, you would deploy it by making a 
Debian package, right?  And naturally if you make a Debian package, the
dependency graph can be safely ignored.  What I mean to say is: good luck.

= Installation =
What, are you kidding me?  chmod +x the file and run it with 
$ python hello.py

= ToDo =
Much, including making a fancy ajax version, and making picture selection
better.

Idea for making picture selection better: Can google (or bing?) give us a 
score for how good a picture was for our search?  If so, set a cutoff and 
any time we go below the cutoff we pick a random picture from 
cuteoverload.com instead.

Another idea for making picture selection better: actually maybe we should just
pair everything with random pictures from cuteoverload.
